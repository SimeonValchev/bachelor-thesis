1. The overall format is in WST with a few additional rules.
2. Capital letters are for variables and all variables are capital letters.
3. Each functions symbol is of type char, so no symbols like 'dbl', 'lin' etc. are allowed.
4. No 'space' allowed when writing terms.
5. Rules are explicitly of the form "l -> r" with the 'space' before and after the arrow.
6. The path to the source file can be changed in the main method in Main (line 110). Currently reads the sample.txt directly from the same directory.
